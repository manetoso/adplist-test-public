# **ADPList Test**

**_With its limitations own limitations 😶‍🌫️_**

This is an app created with [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) :scream:.

Thi App use, as backend, the API from [dyte](https://docs.dyte.io/docs/home/introduction) to create videoCalls and [auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication, so cheers to them for that :clap: .

## **Preview**

Preview online live web-app on: [ADPList Test](https://adplist-test.vercel.app/) :wink:

## **Open Source**

I build this little web-app (_and it's really small_) just for a Frontend Test :muscle:, so feel free to check it out :eyes: and use it :space_invader: for your own businesses **carnial!** :wink:.

## **Fast Notes**

The authentication use my own credentials of auth0 for production so it won't work in a devlopment environment.

> ## **Available Scripts**
>
> ### `yarn start`
>
> Runs the app in the development mode.
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
>
> ### `yarn format`
>
> Run [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format all de documents in the proyect.

> ## **Tools Used in this Proyect**
>
> ### [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
>
> Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
> I used Chakra to:
>
> - Create the entire UI of the App.
>
> ### [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
>
> A production-ready motion library for React. Utilize the power behind Framer, the best prototyping tool for teams. Proudly open source.
> I used Framer Motion to:

> - Animate the **_Mobile-Nav-Button_** every time you click on it.
>
> ### [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/)
>
> Closing in on a decade of client-side routing, React Router v6 takes the best features from previous versions—and its sister project, Reach Router—in a smallest and more powerful package.
> I used React Router DOM to:
>
> - Make the Navigation of the App.
>
> ### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
>
> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
> I used Prettier to:
>
> - Give consistent format on the code of the app.
>
> ### [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
>
> Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.
